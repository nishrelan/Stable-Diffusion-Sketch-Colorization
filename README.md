# Stable-Diffusion-Sketch-Colorization

This is one of the repositories used for an EE 562 Project on Sketch Colorization. This repo contains the code for running inference on Kandinsky 2.2, computing FD scores using openai/clip-vit-large-patch14 as the embedding model, and computing CLIP scores using the same CLIP model.
